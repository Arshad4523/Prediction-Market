# Prediction Market

## Project Title
Prediction Market

## Project Description
The Prediction Market contract allows users to participate in decentralized prediction markets, where they can place bets on the outcome of a question. Once the prediction period ends, the owner resolves the prediction, and users who placed correct bets can claim rewards based on the pool of bets.


## Contract Address
0xd5B2438c73c1d3eE0F637749e164dA1F3A3aEE3f

## Project Vision
The vision of the Prediction Market is to create an open platform where users can make predictions on various events and earn rewards based on the accuracy of their bets. The goal is to provide a transparent, decentralized, and automated system where individuals can predict real-world outcomes, from sports events to political elections, and engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.

## Key Features
- **Create Predictions**: The owner can create new prediction markets, specifying the question and closing time for betting.
- **Place Bets**: Users can place bets on ongoing predictions with Ether.
- **Resolve Predictions**: The owner can resolve predictions, determining the outcome and distributing rewards accordingly.
- **Claim Rewards**: Users can claim their rewards after a prediction is resolved, based on their bet and the total pool.
- **Transparency**: All bets, outcomes, and claims are tracked on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.
- **Security**: The contract is designed with safety in mind, with checks to ensure that betting only occurs within the allowed time and only the owner can resolve predictions.
- **No Oracle Required**: The owner determines the outcome, which eliminates the need for third-party oracles, though this can be modified if required.

## How to Use
1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
2. **Create a Prediction**: Use the `createPrediction` function to create a new market with a question and closing time.
3. **Place Bets**: Participants can place bets by calling the `placeBet` function and sending Ether.
4. **Resolve the Prediction**: After the prediction closes, the owner can call `resolvePrediction` to set the outcome.
5. **Claim Rewards**: After resolution, users can claim their rewards using the `claimReward` function.

## Future Improvements
- **Oracle Integration**: Integrate oracles to fetch real-world data automatically for resolving predictions.
- **Multiple Outcomes**: Allow multiple possible outcomes for predictions instead of a binary result.
- **User Interface**: Develop a frontend interface to interact with the contract more easily.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Introduce staking to increase engagement and add additional layers of incentives.
